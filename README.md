A seed project for [Angular 2 seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed) + Rails

**Note** This is meant for a quick start. Pretty sure there's a better way to do this. PRs are welcome :)


```bash
npm install -g ts-node
```

In order to start the seed use:


```bash
bundle install
npm install
npm start #(or npm run build.dev or npm run build.prod )
rails s
```
